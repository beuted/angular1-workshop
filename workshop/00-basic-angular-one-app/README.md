# Angular 1 and webpack

based on http://angular-tips.com/blog/2015/06/using-angular-1-dot-x-with-es6-and-webpack/

This will be our starting point. After looking around and explaining what all this ugly configuration is for, we are going to transform this application from JS to TS progressively.

## Running the app locally
* [Install node](https://nodejs.org)
* run `$ npm install`
* run `$ npm install -g webpack-dev-server`
* run `$ npm run dev`
