# Plain ES5 Angular 1 App

This will be our starting point. This project main technologies are:
* `npm` to load our development dependencies only
* `angular` the js framework on top of wich we are going to build our app
* `jasmine` the test-framework we are goin to use to for unit-testing 

## Running the app locally
* [Install node](https://nodejs.org)
* run `$ npm install`
* run `$ npm install -g webpack-dev-server`
* run `$ npm run dev`
